# PasswordAttack
Creating a GUI-based password attack tool involves several steps, including setting up the graphical user interface (GUI), implementing the password attack logic, and handling user input and feedback. For this example, I'll show you how to create a simple GUI password brute-force tool using PyQt5 for the GUI and Python for the logic.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Install Required Tools
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use pip or pipx to install PyQt5:


pip install pyqt5
For password cracking, you might use a tool like hydra or implement a basic brute-force algorithm. Ensure you have the required libraries for your approach.

2. Create a Basic GUI with PyQt5
Hereâ€™s a basic GUI for a password attack tool. It allows the user to input a target and a wordlist file, then starts the attack when the button is clicked.

3. Create the Project Structure


mkdir gui_password_tool
cd gui_password_tool
Create a Python Script

4. Create a file named password_tool.py:


nano password_tool.py
then add the code and save it 

5. After adding the code run your your tool 

   python password_tool.py
